Our 12 Principles


1. We value collaboration and teamwork, knowing that learning is enhanced when we work together, ask questions, and help one another.
2. We adapt our strategies and solutions based on changing requirements from our instructors.
3. We strive for simplicity in our code and solutions, believing that straightforward solutions are often the most effective. 
4. We embrace an iterative approach to problem-solving, seeking feedback and refinement at each step.
5. We stay flexible in our approach to problem-solving, willing to pivot when necessary.
6. We prioritize writing, testing, and refining actual code, understanding that practical experience is the best teacher.
7. We communicate with peers and instructors to gather insights, requirements, and feedback for building better solutions.
8. We emphasize understanding concepts, problem-solving, and continuous learning rather than memorizing facts and algorithms.
9. We take ownership of our learning and projects, setting our goals, priorities, and deadlines, and being accountable for our progress.
10. We focus on delivering working solutions that meet and go beyond the requirements while also not striving for perfection.
11. We prioritize a working community, mutual support, and helping each other succeed.
12. We aim for high-quality code, seeking mastery in the principles and practices of computer science.
