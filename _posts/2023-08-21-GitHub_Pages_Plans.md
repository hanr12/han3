### PBL Unit 1 / Week 1
Learning outcome. Building a personal and running GitHub Pages.
- Monday - Mr. Mort and Mr. Lopez were still doing live reviews so it gave me and Ellie time to start working on the rest of out blog.
- Tuesday - Mr. Lopez explained how to download the Snake Game onto the CompSci table so that you could play the game
- Wednesday - Started working on the table itself in the CompSci tab
- Thursday - I wasn't sure on how to add more posts to the actual table so I started browsing the code to see if anything correlated with each other to create the posts
- Friday - After figuring out how to ceate more posts using the md and html files, I then started finishing up my CompSci page
