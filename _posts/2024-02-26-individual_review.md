## Project Overview
My team and I decided to create a website that focuses on the improvement of mental health for teenagers. We have different features that help with the organization of plans and emotions as well as a few feautures that help with figetting.

## My feature
My feature helps with organizing ones schedule. The schedule is a list that has days named from sunday through saturday and it gives you the option to fill out what you are planning to do in the morning, noon, and afternoon. By being able to plan out one's schedule like this, they are able to work towards that goal and hopefully improve their own work habits. 

## Team Contributions
- Isabelle and I both worked on the frontend so we made the look of both the login and the sign up page as well as the SASS styling for the entire website. We also worked on a few features including the daily agenda and the mood tracker
- Vidha and Prakruti both worked on the backend while focusing on the api function for the login page as well as the apis for their personal features on the page

## Refletion
Trimester 2 was very difficult for me. While I was in Lopez class I had no clue on what was wrong with my vscode for it to not be able to run ./migrate.sh. I asked Lopez about this issue but it was never resolved until tri 3. Due to this, I was only able to work on the frontend despite my past experiences in Tri 1 with the backend code.

I wasn't very experienced with frontend codes from APIs since I had never experimented with it before and it did not help that I could work with the backend code to check if the frontend code worked if I could not see the databases/ the databases didn't exist for me. Despite these setbacks, I made sure to contact people on what they were doing so that I could keep up with the things that they changed or added on to.

Given these circumstances, I tried my best to work with my teammates so that I could be able to test code with them and test that everything worked smoothly.
