# Commands we will use 
- ls to view files
- cd to go into files (especially with going into repos)
- cat for easy access of what is inside files (to display output )

# Checking tools and versions
- using apt comands to check if tools installed 
- -v to check version of tools : this could also check installations because if does not exist then most likely not installed

# Updating repos 
- sudo apt update
